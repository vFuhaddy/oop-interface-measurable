/**
 This program demonstrates the use of a Measurable Interface.
 BankAccount and Country classes implement the Measurable interface.
 A method average() offers the service of averaging an array of elements -
 but only if the elements are of type Measurable.
 So, arrays that use this service must ensure that the objects in the array
 are of type measurable.
 This is the *contract* between the service and its users.

      Computes the average of the measures of the given objects.

      This method provides the service of getting the average of the measures
      of an array of objects - but only if the objects are Measurable.
      To be "measurable", the objects in the array must have implemented
      the measurable interface and have implemented the getMeasure()
      method.
      The interface is a contract that lists the methods that must be implemented.
      The contract states that a measurable object must provide a measure() method
      that can be called to provide a measure of that object.

    Notice here that the method code depends only on the Interface, and uses
      references of the interface type (i.e. Measurable)
    - All references are of type Measurable
    - All functions called are declared in the interface (i.e. getMeasure() )

    This method can deal only with objects of type Measurable.
